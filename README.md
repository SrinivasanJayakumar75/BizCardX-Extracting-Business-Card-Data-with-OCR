1. The result of the project would be a Streamlit application that allows users to upload
an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name,
designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
2. The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a
database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able
to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
3. The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides
users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its
information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized
manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a
button.
4. The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It would also require careful design and planning of the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals
who need to manage business card information efficiently.
